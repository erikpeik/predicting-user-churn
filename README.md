# Predicting User Churn

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict user churn based on a provided dataset. It uses a linear model (Logistic Regression) to classify users.

## Project Structure

- `linear_model.py`: The main script that loads data, trains the model, evaluates it, and generates predictions.
- `data/`: Directory containing the datasets.
    - `train.csv`: Training data with target labels.
    - `test.csv`: Test data for generating predictions.
    - `submission.csv`: The output file generated by the script.

## Setup

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

    Or, if you prefer using pip directly:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn
    ```

## Usage

To run the training and prediction pipeline:

```bash
python3 linear_model.py
```

## Methodology

The `linear_model.py` script performs the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading**: Reads `train.csv` and `test.csv`.
2.  **Preprocessing**:
    - Splits the training data into training and validation sets (80/20 split).
    - Identifies numeric and categorical features.
    - Applies `StandardScaler` to numeric features.
    - Applies `OneHotEncoder` to categorical features.
3.  **Modeling**: Uses a `LogisticRegression` classifier within a scikit-learn `Pipeline`.
4.  **Evaluation**: Calculates the ROC AUC score on the validation set to assess performance.
5.  **Prediction**: Retrains the model on the full training dataset and generates probability predictions for the test set.
6.  **Submission**: Saves the predictions to `data/submission.csv` in the required format.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.14
- pandas
- scikit-learn
